# Screw The Nether:
<p align="center">
It's deep underground, <br>Pass the bedrock, <br>But don't dig straight down, <br> <br>You'll regret that, <br>But now you feel brave, <br>Equip with your spade, <br> <br>To roam in these caves, <br> <br>Not looking for gold, <br> <br>This stuff's purple, <br>So I've been told, <br>by some people, <br> <br>I'll find a few bricks, <br>Where the two of these mix,
With a couple of clicks, <br> <br>I'll be swaying my pick, <br> <br>This is all the prep I go through, <br> <br>Even if my tools are just make-do, <br>Moving to the Nether, <br>I'm moving to the Nether, <br> <br>I'm moving toooo the Nether, <br> <br>10 blocks is the magical total, <br> <br>As that's enough to build up my portal, <br>Moving to the Nether, <br>I'm moving to the Nether, <br> <br>I'm moving toooo the Nether, <br> <br>Welcome to hell,
